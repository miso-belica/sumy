The exact taxonomic placement of the Black Vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear.
There are three subspecies of Black Vulture:
From the Early to the Late Pleistocene, a prehistoric species of Black Vulture, Coragyps occidentalis, known as the Pleistocene Black Vulture or  somewhat in error  the "Western Black Vulture", occurred across the present species' range.
This bird did not differ much from the Black Vulture of today except in size; it was some 10-15% larger, and had a relatively flatter and wider bill.
Fossil (or subfossil) Black Vultures cannot necessarily be attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative.
The southern birds were of the same size as present-day North Black Vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known.
The Black Vulture is a fairly large bird of prey, measuring 5674 cm (2229 in) in length, with a 1.331.67 m (5266 in) wingspan.
The Black Vulture has a Nearctic and Neotropic distribution.
In comparison with the Turkey Vulture, the Black Vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight.
Like all New World Vultures, the Black Vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation of the water in the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis.
Because it lacks a syrinx, the Black Vulture, like other New World Vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities.
In areas where their ranges overlap, the Black Vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees with groups of Turkey Vultures.
The Black Vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World Vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses.
While some of the glyphs clearly show the Black Vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the King Vulture's knob and are painted black.
