Willis began publishing poetry in his father's Boston Periodical, often using one of two literary personalities under the pen names "Roy" (for religious subjects) and "Cassius" (for more secular topics).
That year, Willis founded the American Monthly Magazine, which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831.
The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.
The couple moved to London where, in 1836, Willis met Charles Dickens, who was working for the Morning Chronicle at the time.
On October 20, 1838, Willis began a series of articles called "A New Series of Letters from London", one of which suggested an illicit relationship between writer Letitia Elizabeth Landon and editor William Jordan.

Willis also introduced Poe to Fanny Osgood; the two would later carry out a very public literary flirtation.
In 1846, Willis and Morris left the Evening Mirror and attempted to edit a new weekly, the National Press, which was renamed the Home Journal after eight months.
During these last years at Idlewild, Willis continued contributing a weekly letter to the Home Journal.
The Home Journal lost many subscribers during the American Civil War, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls' school for income.
Willis built up his reputation in the public at a time when readers were interested in the personal lives of writers.
His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers.
