Kidman, who also played guitar, and Thordendal decided to restore the name Meshuggah for the new band.
Immediately after recording the album, Meshuggah went on a short US tour, and the album was released later in November 1998.
After the new album and the live performances, Meshuggah was beginning to be recognized by mainstream music, guitar, drum and metal magazines.
With this album, Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200 and also became the first band signed to Nuclear Blast to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine.
Catch Thirtythree, the only Meshuggah album on which programmed drums have been used, was released the following year in May 2005.
When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string guitars with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for Nothing and re-released it in 2006.
The EP, which was never played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal.
On Catch Thirtythree, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001's compilation Rare Trax.
The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger.
With 2008's obZen, Meshuggah moved away from the experimentation of 2002's Nothing and 2005's Catch Thirtythree to return to the musical style of its previous albums, such as Contradictions Collapse, Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere, while still maintaining its focus on musical and technical innovation.
Meshuggah has become known for its innovative musical style that evolves between each release and pushes heavy metal into new territory, and for its technical prowess.[f] Hagstrm comments: "We try never to repeat ourselves." Rockdetector stated about Destroy Erase Improve: "[T]he band...stripped Metal down to the bare essentials before completely rebuilding it in a totally abstract form".
Although Meshuggah does not record concept albums, the band prefers strong conceptual underpinnings in the background.
