Another precursor to the modern street newspaper was Cincinnati's Hobo News, which ran from 1915 to 1930[note 1] and featured writing from prominent labor and social activists as well as Industrial Workers of the World members, alongside contributions of oral history, creative writing, and artwork from hoboes, or itinerant beggars.
Most street papers published before 1970, such as The Catholic Worker (founded in 1933 ), were affiliated with religious organizations.
Street News, founded in late 1989 in New York City, is frequently cited as the first modern street newspaper.
While some small papers were already being published when it was founded, Street News attracted the most attention and became the "catalyst" for many other papers.
Street papers have been established in some cities in Canada, Africa, South America, and Asia.
In the mid-1990s, coalitions were established to strengthen the street newspaper movement.
The International Network of Street Papers (INSP) (founded in 1994) and the North American Street Newspaper Association (NASNA) (founded in 1997) aim to provide support for street papers and to "uphold ethical standards".
Many, particularly in the United States, receive aid from local government and charities, and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association provide workshops and support for new street papers.
There has been some disagreement among street newspaper publishers and supporters over whether papers should accept advertising, with some arguing that advertising is practical and helps support the paper, and others claiming that many kinds of advertisements are inappropriate in a paper that is mainly geared towards the poor.
