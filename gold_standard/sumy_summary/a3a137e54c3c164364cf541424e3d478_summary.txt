The results showed no genetic differences between G. marginata and G. autumnalis, G. oregonensis, G. unicolor, and G. venenata, thus reducing all these names to synonymy.
It includes small brown-spored mushrooms characterized by cap edges initially curved inwards, fruit bodies resembling Pholiota or Naucoria and thin-walled, obtuse or acute-ended pleurocystidia that are not rounded at the top.
Within this section, G. autumnalis and G. oregonensis are in stirps Autumnalis, while G. unicolor, G. marginata, and G. venenata are in stirps Marginata.
Autumnalis species are characterized by having a viscid to lubricous cap surface while Marginata species lack a gelatinous capâ€”the surface is moist, "fatty-shining", or matte when wet.
Smith and Singer give the following descriptions of surface texture: from "viscid" (G. autumnalis), to "shining and viscid to lubricous when moist" (G. oregonensis), to "shining, lubricous to subviscid (particles of dirt adhere to surface) or merely moist, with a fatty appearance although not distinctly viscid", to "moist but not viscid" (G. marginata).
Pholiota mutabilis produces fruit bodies roughly similar in appearance and also grows on wood, but may be distinguished from G. marginata by its stems bearing scales up to the level of the ring, and from growing in large clusters (which is not usual of G. marginata).
The related K. vernalis is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to G. marginata.
G. marginata is thought to be the only species of the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture.
Although some mushroom field guides claim that the species (as G. autumnalis) also contains phallotoxins, scientific evidence does not support this contention.
This low frequency may be attributed to the mushroom's nondescript appearance as a "little brown mushroom" leading to it being overlooked by collectors, and by the fact that 21% of amatoxin poisonings were caused by unidentified species.
Several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for hallucinogenic Psilocybe species, such as P. stuntzii.
