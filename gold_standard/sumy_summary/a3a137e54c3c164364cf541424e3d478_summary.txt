Within this section, G. autumnalis and G. oregonensis are in stirps Autumnalis, while G. unicolor, G. marginata, and G. venenata are in stirps Marginata.
When moist, the cap is somewhat transparent so that the outlines of the gills may be seen as striations.
Above the level of the ring, the stem surface has a very fine whitish powder and is paler than the cap; below the ring it is brown down to the reddish-brown to bistre base.
The spore print is rusty-brown.
Similar species Galerina marginata may be mistaken for a few edible mushroom species.
Furthermore, microscopic examination shows smooth spores in Pholiota.
The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well.
Toxicity The toxins found in Galerina marginata are known as amatoxins.
Both amanitins were quantified in G. autumnalis (1.5 mg/g dry weight) and G. marginata (1.1 mg/g dry weight).
However, a 20-year retrospective study of more than 2100 cases of amatoxin poisonings from North American and Europe showed that few cases were due to ingestion of Galerina species.
In 1954, a poisoning was caused by G. venenata.
