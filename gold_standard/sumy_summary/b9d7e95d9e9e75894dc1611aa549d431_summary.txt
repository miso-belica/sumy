He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench.
Solo career In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, Hear the Masses, a self-produced, self-published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions.
The genres main labels – Narada, Windham Music, and Higher Octave – were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established.
Later releases include Christmas Around the World reaching Zone Music Reporter (formerly NAR) top 100 radio playlist; and One Deep Breath also holding a position on ZMR's top 100 radio chart for over six months.
Bill Binkelman writes, "One Deep Breath is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between.
While I doubt fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music."
During the same year, Orange Music released two compilation CDs; The Road Ahead and In the Heart of Everyone, in addition to re-releasing his Christmas Around the World album.
His music is used throughout the DVD, Isle Royale Impressions Volume II, containing video footage by Carl TerHaar of scenery and wildlife from the Isle Royale National Park in Michigan.
His music has been heard in regular rotation in the United States and Canada by more than 160 major radio networks including XM and Sirius satellite radio; in the United Kingdom including RTÉ lyric fm; as well as airwaves in Japan, Spain, China, South-East Asia, Thailand, Germany, Switzerland, and Russia.
The Weather Channel also utilizes his compositions during the "Local on the 8s" segments, and his song "Friday's Child" is included in their 2008 compilation release, The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II.
"The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream."
"Wind Farmer" was inspired by childhood visits to a relative's farm near Olivia, and his company, Robbins Island Music, is named after a city park in Willmar.
