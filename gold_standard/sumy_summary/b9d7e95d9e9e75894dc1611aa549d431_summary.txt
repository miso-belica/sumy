The War Cry was sold by Salvation Army officers and the working poor to draw people's attention to the poor living conditions of these individuals.
Street News, founded in late 1989 in New York City, is frequently cited as the first modern street newspaper.
After 1989, at least 100 papers sprung up in over 30 countries.
Street papers have been started in many major cities worldwide, mainly in the United States and Western Europe.
While many street newspapers aim to provide coverage of social issues and educate the public about homelessness, this goal is often secondary: many people who buy street newspapers do so to support and express solidarity with the homeless vendor, rather than to read the paper.
Vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges or messenger bags.
Some, such as Street Sense, are begun by homeless or formerly homeless individuals, whereas others are more professional ventures.
On the other hand, those papers that do sell well and are widely read, such as The Big Issue, are often targets of criticism for being too "mainstream" or commercial.
