The land on which the fort was to be located was a part of a 560-acre (230 ha; 0.87 sq mi) tract owned first by one James Oliphant, then by a Fergus Sloan.
Workmen under Waddell's command began construction in 1756, but in 1757, Catawba leaders, influenced by South Carolina Governor William Lyttelton, informed North Carolina's government that they no longer wished for this second fort to be built, and construction of the second fort was permanently halted.
Site preservation and archaeology Archaeological exploration of the site first occurred in 1847, when a group of local residents attempted to locate a rumored original cannon on the site.
That same year, the owners of the parcel of land on which the Fort Dobbs site was located donated 1,000 square feet (93 m2) containing the fort's remains to the Fort Dobbs Chapter.
Excavation began in 1967, and by 1968, the site of the fort was confirmed.
Additionally, excavations revealed a moat that surrounded the blockouse, as well as trash in the moat contemporary with the fort.
Archaeological work has unearthed evidence of a palisade surrounding the blockhouse, in a similar fashion to other French and Indian War-era forts such as Fort Shirley near Heath, Massachusetts, and Fort Prince George.
From these comparisons, the contemporary description of the fort, and the soil record, Babits concluded that the "opposite angles" described by Francis Brown in 1756 actually referred to "flankers", or square wooden structures attached to the corner of the fort that would have allowed defending soldiers to shoot into the flank of any attacking forces surrounding the building.
Outdoor trails lead visitors through the excavated ruins of the fort.
Events, including many living history demonstrations, are held throughout the year at the fort.
