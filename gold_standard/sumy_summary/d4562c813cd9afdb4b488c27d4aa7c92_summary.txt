Allen, 1901, from Ecuador as synonyms, but without examining the holotypes.
Oryzomys talamancae was also included; it appeared within "clade B", together with other species formerly associated with Oryzomys capito.
It is similar to T. bolivaris and the two are often confused.
H. megacephalus also has darker fur.
The ears are dark brown, large, and densely covered with very small hairs.
The hindfeet are long and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones.
As in most oryzomyines, females have eight mammae.
Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar.
In Transandinomys talamancae,[Note 4] a single pair of preputial glands is present at the penis.
Both T. bolivaris and H. alfaroi have more chromosomes and arms, at 2n = 58, FN = 80 and 2n = 60–62, FN = 100–104 respectively.
It occurs throughout Panama at low elevations.
There is a record from the Orinoco Delta of northeastern Venezuela, well within the range of Hylaeamys megacephalus, but Musser and colleagues suggest that this is based on mislabeled specimens.
G. aitkeni has also been found on this species in Colombia.
