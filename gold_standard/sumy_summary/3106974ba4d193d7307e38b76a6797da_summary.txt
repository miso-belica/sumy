Life and career Early life and family Nathaniel Parker Willis was born on January 20, 1806, in Portland, Maine.
The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.
He and Stace had a second daughter, Imogen, who was born June 20, 1842.
As a later journalist remarked, this made Willis "the first magazine writer who was tolerably well paid".
Evening Mirror Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, along with George Pope Morris, the weekly New York Mirror as the daily Evening Mirror in 1844 with a weekly supplement called the Weekly Mirror, in part due to the rising cost of postage.
Willis's wife Mary Stace died in childbirth on March 25, 1845.
He edited the Home Journal until his death in 1867.
As the press reported, "thousands and thousands of the anxious public" awaited the court's verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis's name was cleared.
As Fanny Fern, she had published Fern Leaves, which sold over 100,000 copies the year before.
I am sorry that any editor knows that a sister of mine wrote some of these which you sent me", he wrote.
Among his later works, following in his traditional sketches about his life and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855).
His pallbearers included Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel Gridley Howe, and James Thomas Fields.
For a time, it was said that Willis was the "most-talked-about author" in the United States.
Poe questioned Willis's fame, however.
