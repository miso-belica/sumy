Its outer edge is located at a radius of about 129 000 km (1.806 RJ; RJ = equatorial radius of Jupiter or 71 398 km) and coincides with the orbit of Jupiter's smallest inner satellite, Adrastea.
Thus the width of the main ring is around 6 500 km.
Inward of Metis's orbit the brightness of the ring rises much less than in forward-scattered light.
In the side scatter geometry the ring thickness is 80–160 km, increasing somewhat in the direction of Jupiter.
This optical depth means that the total cross section of all particles inside the ring is about 5000 km².
The mass of large bodies, excluding Metis and Adrastea, is 1011−1016 kg.
Its shape resembles a thick torus without clear internal structure.
The halo’s appearance in the back-scattered light, as observed by Keck and HST, is the same.
The halo ring’s inner boundary is not far from the strongest 2:1 Lorentz resonance.
In 2002–2003 Galileo spacecraft had two passes through the gossamer rings.
During them its dust counter detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5 μm.
It follows a power law with q < 2.
Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively.
Himalia ring The small moon S/2000 J 11, 4 kilometres in diameter, had gone missing since its discovery in 2000.
This possible ring appears as a faint streak near Himalia in images from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto.
