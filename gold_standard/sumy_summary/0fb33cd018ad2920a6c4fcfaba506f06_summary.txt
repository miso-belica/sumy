In addition to an existing installed capacity[a] of 1.3 Gigawatts (GW) of hydro-electric schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5 GW of wind and 7.5 GW of tidal power, 25% of the estimated total capacity for the European Union and up to 14 GW of wave power potential, 10% of EU capacity.
Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands.
There is also further potential for new pump storage schemes that would work well with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave.
A small wind farm on Shetland with five Vestas V47 660 kW turbines recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity over the course of a year.
There are now numerous large on-shore power stations including Black Law Wind Farm rated at over 96 MW, Hadyard Hill Wind Farm, which is the first wind farm in the UK able to generate over 100 MW, and Whitelee Wind Farm, a 322 MW project that was the largest onshore wind farm in Europe, but has been superseded by the Clyde Wind Farm.
In early 2010 two areas were identified for substantial offshore wind development, in the Moray Firth basin and outer Firth of Forth.
Tidal power Unlike wind and wave, tidal power is an inherently predictable source.
In October 2010 MeyGen, a consortium of Morgan Stanley, Atlantis Resources Corporation and International Power, received a 25 year operational lease from the Crown Estate for a 400MW tidal power project in the Pentland Firth.
Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps.
In Edinburgh, Tynecastle High School, due to be completed in 2010, will be heated by waste heat from the neighbouring North British Distillery.
Thus, plans for one of the world's largest onshore windfarms on the Hebridean island of Lewis, have generated considerable debate.
