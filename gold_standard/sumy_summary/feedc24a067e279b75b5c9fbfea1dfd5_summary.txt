By mid-2011 these figures were 2.76 GW and 4.6 GW respectively.
At the end of 2011, there was 4,796 megawatts (MW) of installed renewables electricity capacity in Scotland, an increase of 9.5 per cent (416 MW) on the end of 2010.
Hydro-electric power Scotland has 85% of the UK's hydro-electric energy resource, much of it developed by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in the 1950s.
Wind turbines are the fastest growing of the renewable energy technologies in Scotland.
The Siadar Wave Energy Project was announced in 2009.
Several other tidal sites with considerable potential exist in the Orkney archipelago.
The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy.
The current Scottish output is negligible.
Carbon sequestration: Also known as carbon capture and storage, this technology involves the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is a by-product of industrial processes through its injection into oil fields.
There are a number of Scottish projects involved in this research, supported by the Scottish Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Association (SHFCA).
