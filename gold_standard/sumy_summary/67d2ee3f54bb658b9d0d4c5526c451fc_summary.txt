In Great Britain, 16.2 hands (66 inches, 168 cm) is the shortest acceptable height for stallions and 16.1 hands (65 inches, 165 cm) for mares, while weights range from around 2,000 to 2,200 pounds (910 to 1,000 kg) for stallions and 1,800 to 2,000 pounds (820 to 910 kg) for mares.
The head has a straight profile, broad forehead, large eyes and small ears.
The chest is deep and wide and the croup long and level.
The feet and legs are clean and heavily muscled.
They are considered easy keepers and adapt well to many conditions and climates.
In the 19th century, they were known to travel up to 60 kilometres (37 mi) a day at a trot.
A possible reference to the horse is made in the 13th-century romance Guillaume de Dole, in which the titular character asks for "the Count of Perche's horse" to be made ready, possibly indicating the "'great horse,' which could accommodate an armored knight" and was bred in the geographical setting of the poem.
This new type of horse was called the "Diligence Horse", because the stage coaches they pulled were named "diligences".
Soon after, two stallions and two mares were imported; one mare died shortly after arrival and one stallion went blind and was retired within a year.
In 1851, three stallions were imported: Normandy 351, Louis Napoleon 281 and Gray Billy.
Large numbers of Percherons were imported to the United States beginning in the early 1870s, and they became popular with draft horse breeders and owners.
In 1877, the word "Norman" was dropped from the name.
Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.
Also in 1993, the Société Hippique Percheronne anticipated the increasing tourist and exportation markets by prohibiting docking, which was not prohibited for other draft breeds until 1996.
This was partly at the request of the Germans, and partly due to the influence of magazines such as Cheval.
