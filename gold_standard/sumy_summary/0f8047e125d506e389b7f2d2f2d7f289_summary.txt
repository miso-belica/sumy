The exact taxonomic placement of the Black Vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear.
There are three subspecies of Black Vulture: Evolutionary history of Coragyps From the Early to the Late Pleistocene, a prehistoric species of Black Vulture, Coragyps occidentalis, known as the Pleistocene Black Vulture or – somewhat in error – the "Western Black Vulture", occurred across the present species' range.
Weight for Black Vultures from North America and the Andes ranges from 1.6 to 2.75 kilograms (3.5–6 lb) but in the smaller vultures of the tropical lowlands it is 1.18–1.94 kg (2.6–4.3 lbs).
In comparison with the Turkey Vulture, the Black Vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight.
Like all New World Vultures, the Black Vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation of the water in the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis.
Because it lacks a syrinx, the Black Vulture, like other New World Vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities.
In areas where their ranges overlap, the Black Vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees with groups of Turkey Vultures.
The Black Vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of Black Vultures can easily drive a Turkey Vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.
This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.
The Black Vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World Vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses.
King Vultures and Black Vultures, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow them to carcasses.
However, various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts and even the Ornate Hawk-Eagle, a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, have preyed on adult black vultures.
The droppings produced by Black Vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation.
While some of the glyphs clearly show the Black Vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the King Vulture's knob and are painted black.
