Initially fairywrens were thought to be a member of the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975.
Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene.
Lifespan Survival of fairywrens from one season to the next is generally high for such small birds, and the Red-winged Fairywren has the highest rate of allâ€”with 78% of breeding males and 77% of breeding females surviving from year to year.
It is not unusual for Red-winged Fairywrens to reach 10 years of age, and the oldest known individual to date attained an age of 16 years.
Behaviour Hopping, with both feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously, is the usual form of locomotion, though birds may run while performing the 'Rodent Run Display' detailed below.
Over half the groups have two or more helpers, often female, which feed nestlings and reduce workload of breeding females.
Helpers have been shown to improve reproductive success in this species by increasing the numbers of young raised successfully per year from 1.3 to 2 birds.
Like other species of fairy wrens, Red-winged Fairywrens may use a 'Rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds.
Observed in this species, the 'Wing-fluttering' display is seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male courtship displays, juveniles while begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones.
It consumes a wide range of small creatures, mostly insects, eating ants and beetles year-round, and adding spiders, bugs and caterpillars to their diet during breeding season.
Ants in particular are an important food source during this period, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet.
Courtship and breeding Like other fairywrens, male Red-winged Fairywrens have been observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females as part of a courtship ritual.
In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow or, rarely, white.
