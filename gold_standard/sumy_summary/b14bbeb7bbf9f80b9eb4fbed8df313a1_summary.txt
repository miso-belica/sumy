He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia.
Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations.
Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,000â€“13,000 years ago, the northern Variegated forms have again spread southwards.
The average tail length is 7.5 cm (3 in), among the longest in the genus.
