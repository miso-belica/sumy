Hi,

first of all, thank you you are considering to contribute to sumy. Because people started to send
more Pull request I would like to set some rules here to make it easier and faster to review PR
with your code. Nothing is written in stone but please try to respect them.

1. If the change is not few lines of code **ask if the feature is needed**. I would like to avoid
   situation when **week of work will be rejected** because the feature is something what should 
   be in sumy. On the other hand if it's **10 lines it's easier to send PR** with changes and discuss 
   the code in PR. If it would be rejected it's 10 still lines of code so not a big deal (I hope) :)
2. If you add some new feature please **add tests** for it. Also if you fix a bug write test for it.
   I don' believe fixes without tests. If you don't know how **ask me for help** in PR with code.
3. When the PR changes something what should be known to end user please **add a line into CHANGELOG.md**.
4. Please **respect the code style**. I don't want to set specific strict rules here because I think it's 
   possible to respect style from all the code around. For example you will not use `'` for strings 
   when you see that the code uses `"` ...

And that's all. I am looking forward for your PR :)
